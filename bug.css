The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this scenario, the `.parent .child` selector has higher specificity than `.child`, overriding the `!important` declaration.  While `!important` typically has the highest precedence, specificity rules take precedence over it. The resulting text color would be green, not red. This is unexpected because `!important` is generally assumed to be the strongest.
