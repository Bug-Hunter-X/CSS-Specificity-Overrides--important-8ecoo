The solution involves a restructuring of the CSS to avoid conflicts. Instead of relying on `!important`, leverage CSS specificity effectively. Here is the corrected code:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

/* Alternatively, if the red color is crucial, increase specificity of .child */
.parent .child {
  color: green; 
}
.parent .child.specific-child {
  color: red; 
}
```

By adjusting the selectors or using more specific rules, the expected styling behavior can be achieved without the use of `!important`.
